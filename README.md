# Fake_reviews_detection - NLP (Natural Language Processing)

## Introduction
In the context of the Jedha Bootcamp Full Stack curriculum,
this was our final project after an intensive 12 week Data Science Bootcamp.
We found this subject interesting as current research has found that around 20% of the reviews on internet are estimated to be fake while online reviews influencing the purchase decisions for 93% of people.

## Objective and Motivations
The project aim's at creating a machine learning algorithm to detect french fake reviews on Yelp.fr.
We wanted to base our study on french reviews as it has hardly been done so far in this language.
Moreover, fake reviews can be devastating for one's business :
* Customers who are misleaded won't trust a marketplace or a review site anymore. 
* Some quality products may be underrated while some low-quality products are being overrated which leads to an unfair competition.
